This is an HTML site with css and seo best practices

# Semantic Tags
In this project, I removed all of the <div> elements and replaced them semantic tags, which are specific to content within the tag.

# Image alt Text
In this project, I added alt-text to the images on the page. 

# Clean CSS
In the project, I removed the redundancies from my css sheet, using element selectors to create rules for various elements all at once. 

# Images of final website
Here are some screenshot of the finished website after I adjusted the code.
